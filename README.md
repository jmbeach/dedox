# Dedox Library

Dedox is a library for helping people protect themselves from being doxed.

It uses Nightmare (a headless browser) to go to the major "people search
engines" and "background check" websites and other various doxing
websites to request to opt you out of their service.

**Still under development**. `src/quitters` contains one file right now
which aims to opt out of the people search engine
[Intelius](https://www.intelius.com/). 

The goal is to make an API for listing and opting out of search engines
like it. Also, the goal is to make dedox able to find your information
that you have made public on social media and information that has been
made public about you on other mediums and at least make users aware of
what's out there, if not give them the tools to remove it. 

Then in the future, I want to make a client for calling the API, and
eventually, a website where users can easily utilize Dedox.
